# Graph_Coloring

The solution folder contains the solutions to 93 instances verified by our algorithm.

"instance_reduction_clique.xlsx" records the features of each instance after reduction, using the maximum clique size calculated by CliSAT(https://github.com/psanse/CliSAT) within 1 second.

Instances after reduction are in instanceReduce folder.
